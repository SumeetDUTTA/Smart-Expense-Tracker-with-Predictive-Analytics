# Project Title

A brief one-sentence description of your frontend project.

## 📝 Description

Provide a detailed overview of the project. Explain its purpose, the problem it solves, and its target audience. Describe the main functionalities and what makes this project unique.

## ✨ Features

Here's a list of the key features you have implemented in the frontend:

-   **User Authentication:** Secure login, registration, and session management using [e.g., JWT, OAuth].
-   **Responsive Design:** The application is fully responsive and provides a seamless experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices using [e.g., CSS Media Queries, Flexbox, Grid].
-   **Component-Based Architecture:** Built using a modular structure with reusable components for easier maintenance and scalability.
-   **State Management:** Centralized state management using [e.g., Redux Toolkit, React Context, Zustand] to handle application-wide data, such as user info and theme settings.
-   **Client-Side Routing:** Implemented dynamic routing with [e.g., React Router] to navigate between different pages without a full page reload.
-   **CRUD Operations:** Users can Create, Read, Update, and Delete [e.g., posts, products, tasks] through an intuitive user interface.
-   **API Integration:** Asynchronous communication with the backend API using [e.g., Axios, Fetch API] to retrieve and send data.
-   **Form Handling & Validation:** User-friendly forms with real-time, client-side validation using [e.g., Formik, React Hook Form].

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

-   **Framework:** [e.g., React.js, Vue.js, Angular]
-   **State Management:** [e.g., Redux, Context API, Pinia]
-   **Routing:** [e.g., React Router, Vue Router]
-   **Styling:** [e.g., Tailwind CSS, Material-UI, Styled Components, SCSS]
-   **API Client:** [e.g., Axios, Fetch API]
