```

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the frontend running locally.

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v16 or later)
-   npm or yarn
-   Backend API running on `http://localhost:5000` (see backend README)
-   ML API running on `http://localhost:8000` (see mlModel README)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/SumeetDUTTA/ExepnseKeeper.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the frontend directory:
    ```sh
    cd frontend
    ```
3.  Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

### Configuration

No `.env` file needed for frontend by default. API URLs are configured in `src/lib/api.js`:
-   Backend API: `http://localhost:5000/api`

To change API endpoints, edit `src/lib/api.js`.

### Running the Application

Start the Vite development server:
```sh
npm run dev
```
The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## 📜 Available Scripts

-   `npm run dev`: Starts Vite dev server with hot module replacement on port 5173
-   `npm run build`: Builds production-optimized bundle to `dist/` folder
-   `npm run preview`: Previews production build locally
-   `npm run lint`: Runs ESLint to check code quality

## 🎨 Theme System

The application uses CSS custom properties (design tokens) for theming. All colors, shadows, and spacing are defined in `src/index.css`:

**Design Tokens:**
-   `--bg-primary`, `--bg-secondary`: Background colors
-   `--text-primary`, `--text-secondary`, `--text-muted`: Text colors
-   `--accent-primary`, `--accent-secondary`: Accent colors
-   `--card-bg`, `--panel`, `--glass`: Surface colors
-   `--border-color`: Border and divider colors
-   `--shadow-sm`, `--shadow-md`, `--shadow-lg`: Shadow levels

**Theme Toggle:**
Users can switch between light and dark themes using the sun/moon icon in the navbar. Theme preference is persisted to localStorage.

## 🔒 Authentication Flow

1.  New user visits `/` → Sees landing page with project overview and features
2.  User clicks "Get Started" or "Login" → Redirected to `/login`
3.  User registers or logs in → Backend validates → Returns JWT token
4.  Token stored in localStorage and AuthContext
5.  User auto-redirected to `/dashboard` after successful login
6.  Protected routes check auth status → Redirect to `/login` if unauthenticated
7.  All API requests include `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
8.  Token refresh handled by backend (7-day expiry)
9.  Logout clears localStorage and redirects to login
10. Authenticated users trying to access `/` are auto-redirected to `/dashboard`
