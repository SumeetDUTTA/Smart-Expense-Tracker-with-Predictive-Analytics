# ExpenseKeeper Frontend

React-based web application for tracking expenses with real-time analytics and machine learning-powered predictions.

## 📝 Description

The ExpenseKeeper frontend is a modern, responsive single-page application that provides users with an intuitive interface to manage their personal finances. Built with React and Vite, it features a comprehensive dashboard with interactive charts, expense management tools, and predictive analytics powered by a machine learning backend. The application uses a custom design system with light/dark theme support, ensuring a consistent and accessible user experience across all devices.

-   **Form Handling & Validation:** Custom controlled forms with real-time validation, character limits, and user-friendly error messages
-   **Data Visualization:** Interactive charts using Recharts (line charts, pie charts, bar charts) with responsive containers and tooltips
-   **Predictive Analytics UI:** Multi-month expense forecasting with category breakdowns, confidence indicators, and budget comparison
-   **Theme System:** Light/dark mode toggle with CSS custom properties (design tokens) for consistent theming across all components
-   **Accessibility:** ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and semantic HTML throughout
-   **Toast Notifications:** React Hot Toast for success/error feedback with custom styling
-   **Lazy Loading:** Intersection Observer for on-demand chart rendering on mobile devices to optimize performance

-   **Build Tool:** Vite 5.x for fast dev server and optimized production builds
-   **State Management:** React Context API for authentication, local state for UI
-   **Routing:** React Router v6 with NavLink, useNavigate, useLocation
-   **Styling:** TailwindCSS 3.x + DaisyUI for utility-first styling and component themes
-   **Charts:** Recharts for responsive, declarative data visualization
-   **Icons:** Lucide React for consistent, customizable SVG icons
-   **API Client:** Axios with interceptors for centralized request/response handling
-   **Notifications:** React Hot Toast for user feedback
-   **Package Manager:** npm

```

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the frontend running locally.

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v16 or later)
-   npm or yarn
-   Backend API running on `http://localhost:5000` (see backend README)
-   ML API running on `http://localhost:8000` (see mlModel README)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/SumeetDUTTA/Smart-Expense-Tracker-with-Predictive-Analytics.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the frontend directory:
    ```sh
    cd frontend
    ```
3.  Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

### Configuration

No `.env` file needed for frontend by default. API URLs are configured in `src/lib/api.js`:
-   Backend API: `http://localhost:5000/api`

To change API endpoints, edit `src/lib/api.js`.

### Running the Application

Start the Vite development server:
```sh
npm run dev
```
The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## 📜 Available Scripts

-   `npm run dev`: Starts Vite dev server with hot module replacement on port 5173
-   `npm run build`: Builds production-optimized bundle to `dist/` folder
-   `npm run preview`: Previews production build locally
-   `npm run lint`: Runs ESLint to check code quality

## 🎨 Theme System

The application uses CSS custom properties (design tokens) for theming. All colors, shadows, and spacing are defined in `src/index.css`:

**Design Tokens:**
-   `--bg-primary`, `--bg-secondary`: Background colors
-   `--text-primary`, `--text-secondary`, `--text-muted`: Text colors
-   `--accent-primary`, `--accent-secondary`: Accent colors
-   `--card-bg`, `--panel`, `--glass`: Surface colors
-   `--border-color`: Border and divider colors
-   `--shadow-sm`, `--shadow-md`, `--shadow-lg`: Shadow levels

**Theme Toggle:**
Users can switch between light and dark themes using the sun/moon icon in the navbar. Theme preference is persisted to localStorage.

## 🔒 Authentication Flow

1.  User registers via `/register` → Backend creates account → Auto-redirect to login
2.  User logs in via `/login` → Backend validates → Returns JWT token
3.  Token stored in localStorage and AuthContext
4.  Protected routes check auth status → Redirect to login if unauthenticated
5.  All API requests include `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
6.  Token refresh handled by backend (7-day expiry)
7.  Logout clears localStorage and redirects to login
